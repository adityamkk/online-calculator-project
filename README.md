Simple online calculator application on the browser with several features.

## Description

The calculator has an input box and an output box located near the top of the screen. Whatever is typed, either by the buttons on the screen, or by the keyboard, will appear in the input box. When either the enter key is pressed or the "equals" button is pressed, the output will be displayed in the output box, located below the input box.

The buttons for the calculator are located below the output box. They are colored either green, orange, or yellow, which indicates a certain type of functionality. Orange buttons are for operations, such as trig functions, exponents, logarithms, and inverse trig functions.

Yellow buttons are for digits and are mostly located below the orange buttons. Additionally, there are two yellow buttons for pi and e located near the top of the button panel.

Finally, green buttons are miscellaneous and perform operations such as converting from radian or degree mode, clearing the input box, or performing operations.

Below the button panel is a history log that goes up to 7 entries. Each input and output is stored by recency in the history, with inputs in the light gray boxes and outputs in the dark gray boxes. The entries in each box can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on them.

Entries that are empty will instead display "NaN".

Lastly, a dark mode feature is available for those who dislike the light mode default. It can be toggled with the button on the top right corner of the screen, above the calculator. 

There may be bugs still undiscovered.
